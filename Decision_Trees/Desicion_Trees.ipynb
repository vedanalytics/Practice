    "<p>The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome.  One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't.  In our bear wrestling example, a decision tree can pick up on the fact that you should only wrestle large bears when escape is impossible, whereas a linear regression would have had to weight both factors in the absence of the other.</p>\n",
